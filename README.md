# Chess_Evaluator
Didn`t want to pay for chess.com evaluation, fun little script of the weekend.
uses png notation as input.

Not polished yet but in good condition, Working on understanding how evaluations are made
and how to identify Blunders, misses and missed wins.

uses Stockfish engine from https://stockfishchess.org/download/
sets engine lvl appropriatelly.
sets time analysing each move.
in case of blunder it looks 3 moves down the tree and returns the best move.

future thoughts: handling time management
